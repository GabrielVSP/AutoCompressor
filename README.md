# Auto Compressor

Auto Compressor is a simple and efficient application that monitors a specific folder to detect new videos, compresses these files automatically, and sends them to another destination folder.

## 📜 Features
* Folder Monitoring: Continuously observes a user-defined folder.
* Auto-compression: Automatically compresses videos as soon as they are added.
* Send to Destination Folder: Moves the processed videos to a configured output folder.
* Customizable Settings: Allows you to define input and output folders and adjust compression settings.

## 🚀 How it works
* Set the folders: Choose an input folder (where the videos will be added) and an output folder (where the compressed videos will be stored).
* Launch the app: Auto Compressor will start monitoring the input folder automatically.
* Add Videos: Once a video is detected in the input folder, it will be compressed and moved to the output folder.
